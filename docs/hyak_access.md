# Hyak Access

## Applying for Access

1. Make sure you are eligible and have [<ins>**joined RCC**</ins>](index.md#joining-rcc).
2. Review the [<ins>**Hyak Prerequisites**</ins>](prerequisites.md). Hyak is used through a linux command line. For many researchers, HPC resources are the first time they encounter this. This is fine! But you should spend a bit of time making sure you grasp the basics before moving to the supercomputer.
3. Read the [<ins>**Hyak Documentation**</ins>](https://hyak.uw.edu/docs) in full. Further, you should consider attending an in-person [<ins>**Hyak training session**</ins>](events.md#hyak-trainings).
4. Read and agree to the RCC Hyak resource [<ins>**terms of service**</ins>](hyak_TOS.md).
5. Complete the [<ins>**RCC Hyak skills assessment**</ins>](https://forms.office.com/r/h7Ecdpfh2z). Completion of this form serves as your application for access to Hyak and will trigger the review of all requirements. It may take up to 5 business days to grant access. If you have not heard back after 5 days, you may email RCC leadership or reach out to an officer on slack.

## Completing Set Up

Once you receive an email stating that your access has been granted, there's a few more steps:

1. Make sure two-factor authentication is set up. It almost certainly is, but you can check this at [<ins>**HERE**</ins>](https://itconnect.uw.edu/tools-services-support/access-authentication/2fa/).
2. Be sure to [<ins>**Subscribe to the Hyak mailing list**</ins>](https://mailman1.u.washington.edu/mailman/listinfo/hyak-users) for reminders about monthly maintenance and training opportunity announcements.
